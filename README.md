Web Scraping(also termed Screen Scraping, Web Data Extraction, Web Harvesting, etc.) is a technique to extract huge amounts of data from websites whereby the data is extracted and saved to a local file in your computer or to a database table. This technique mostly focuses on the transformation of unstructured data (HTML format) on the web into structured data (database or spreadsheet).


Letâ€™s take a random use case in which we are going to perform below-mentioned tasks:

1. Search Google for a user given input, up to first 10 pages, and scrape all the URL titles, URLs and Descriptions and store it as a CSV/JSON in your local system.
2. Crawl through all the pages of the extracted URLs and extract contact details(phone numbers and Email address).
3. Store the extracted contact information in your local system.
